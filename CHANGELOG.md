# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### CHANGED

-   `vgtk` now uses `gtk` version 0.9, along with the matching versions of its dependencies. This
    will affect your code, as many method names have changed, most notably the names of specialised
    widget constructors. You should consult the
    [gtk-rs blog](https://gtk-rs.org/blog/2020/07/04/new-release.html) for details on the changes.

### ADDED

-   New child properties `action_widget_start` and `action_widget_end` for `Notebook` let you add
    children as action widgets to notebooks. (#47)
-   There's a new function `vgtk::run_dialog_props()` for launching a dialog component with a given
    set of properties, where `vgtk::run_dialog()` would use `Default::default()` to construct a
    properties object for you. (#43)
-   A new child property `custom_title` on `HeaderBar` lets you set a widget as a custom title,
    emulating the `set_custom_title()` method. (#38)

## [0.2.1] - 2020-02-24

### ADDED

-   A new function `vgtk::start()` has been added to initialise an `Application` component without
    starting the GTK event loop. It has the added benefit of returning a `Scope` which you can use
    to communicate with your component from async jobs other than the standard
    `UpdateAction::defer()` mechanism.
-   `UpdateAction` now has a `From` implementation for `Future<Output = Component::Message>`,
    allowing you to return `async {...}.into()` from your update function instead of the slightly
    more verbose `UpdateAction::defer(async {...})`.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-02-20

### CHANGED

-   `Callback`s can now have empty values (constructed by `Default::default()`), obviating the need
    to wrap them in `Option<>`. The coercion for `Option<Callback<>>` for functions has been
    replaced with one for just `Callback<>` as a consequence, which means you'll have to update your
    subcomponents: just replace any `Option<Callback<A>>` with `Callback<A>` in your properties, and
    remove the `Some` check on `self.on_my_callback.send()`â€”you can just call `send()` on an empty
    callback directly now, and it will quietly do nothing. If you'd rather not needlessly construct
    the value for `send()` when a callback is empty, you can use `Callback::is_empty()` as a
    predicate instead of the `Some` check.

### ADDED

-   A macro `gtk_if!` has been added, to automate the common case of conditionally inserting a child
    widget.
-   Subcomponents will now accept signal handler syntax, rendering `on signal=|| {}` into
    `on_signal=|| {}`, for consistency.
-   Properties which want an `Option<&A>` will now accept an `Option<A>`. (#33)

## [0.1.0] - 2020-02-07

Initial release.
